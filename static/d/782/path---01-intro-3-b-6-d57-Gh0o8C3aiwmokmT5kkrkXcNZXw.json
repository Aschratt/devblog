To be honest, Iâ€™ve never been very active blogging and I do not think that this will change in the future. I do, however, have some projects that I want to share with the world, that are not very well suited for other forms of content. So expect some content around here soon! ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>But until then, maybe I can give those who <a href=\"https://gtaforums.com/profile/152913-aschratt/\">remember me</a> a quick update and introduce myself to those who do not know me. Furthermore, I want to use the occasion to give a retrospective view into my earlier web-presences and lay out my plans for the future for you.</p>\n<h3>About me and my web-history</h3>\n<p>Lorem ipsum</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2006: Domain</li>\n<li>2007: First website (â€¦, Board -> Community ?!)</li>\n<li>2011: Second attempt (â€¦, Tasty design, yet not much content left)</li>\n<li>Somewhere around 2015: ASP.NET version (Blog, but to posts.)\n-> Archive.org</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lessons learnt from professional software development</h3>\n<p>The problem with websites is, that I was always more interested in creating, rather than maintaining them. In hindsight my web-presence did also never really fit a purpose. So why start over again?</p>\n<p>Ever since I graduated from school, I was more and more involved in industrial software development. Sitting in front of a computer screen all day does not exactly make you excited to continue with it after you get home. I was more and more frustrated and had less fun programming. Professional software development somewhat turned out to be this overly-bureaucratic process for me. During my first years I actually spent more time on phone conferences and meetings, than developing actual <em>solutions</em>. I was, however, not the only developer in my company feeling this way, which is why we later decided to transition to a more agile development process. This actually turned out to  work better for me and my colleagues with every month we worked this way, but it did not prevent that I already had lost much interest in <em>what</em> we were actually developing. Whilst technologically we wrote awesome software, that did its job (and it did so very well), I continued to feel that it was the kind of software I want to write for the rest of my life. I had to find solutions for problems, that did attract my interest less and less. Additionally, I saw the code I wrote sometimes conflicting with my moral world view. Fine, youâ€™ve increased productivity for some large industrial customer, by automating their processes, saving them money and time. And by rendering the jobs of those people, whose work youâ€™ve automated completely obsolete.</p>\n<p>This was not the kind of work I wanted to do. I always enjoyed working creatively and Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by computer graphics and game engines. For me, those complex systems, that simulate reality trying to provide photo-realistic graphics, deceptively real physics and thrilling interactive stories at real-time always have been constructs of beauty for me. Programing such complex systems is an art form and the people who design and implement those systems are some of the most creative masterminds in the industry. I found this to be the direction I wanted to go, so I decided to pick up a second university study again, this time focussing on computer graphics. In the end, researching any CG-related topic turned out to give me a better understanding of the real-world. How to describe textures? Better understand how light behaves at real-world surfaces first!</p>\n<p>So during the last years, Iâ€™ve found my profession in researching those things. This turned out positive in multiple ways. First, I am working more creative than ever. I am free to try out different approaches with no time constraint. I am free to make mistakes, in fact finding solutions for them even motivates me! And I am free to share my research with people who are interested in the same things as me. For a fair degree, collaboration has replaced competition.</p>\n<p>And in the end, thatâ€™s why I decided to get my website and blog back online again. To share and talk about the things I am interested in, so maybe somebody else will find it useful.</p>\n<h3>What I have planned for this site/blog</h3>\n<p>Now I have different plans for the future of this website and blog.</p>\n<p>First of all, I wanted to have a central platform for all my work, which Github turned out to be perfect for. I want to make as much of my research projects available here, if I can. If you are interested in bits and bytes, check out my <a href=\"https://github.com/Aschratt?tab=repositories\">repositories</a>! I am also still in the process of cleaning up and saving some of my old sources from the GTA era. I have some interesting projects that are, honestly speaking, probably not be of much use any more, but I want to share them anyway.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I want to use this blog to write about projects that are not necessarily code-related. The website on the other hand will now get a new purpose as my personal professional portfolio. </p>\n<p>Letâ€™s be honest: I have never been productive enough to justify having a website to promote apps and updates. In the future, I will use Git repositories and Github releases for thisâ€¦ and maybe this blog, if something needs detailed description. My projects also never had a large enough scope to justify running board or moderating a community around it.</p>\n<p>So this is what to expect in the future: open source projects, I want to share with you, blog posts about other things I am interested in and some nerdy old-school stuff.</p>\n<p>A fixed schedule on the other hand is not what I want achieve nor could realize with this web-presence.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your reading! If youâ€™ve used to know me from the GTA modding scene, Iâ€™m glad you are still around. If you are interested in my current work, thank you for your interest.
